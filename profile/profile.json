        "Twitter App: The Java application uses a bottom-up approach that can CRUD(create, read and delete) tweets from the CLI via the Twitter REST API. A Java library is also implemented to process the Twitter API; as the Twitter API returns data in the form of JSON. Junit and Mockito were used as testing tools, IntelliJ was used as a IDE and source code control was performed through git. Also, Maven was used to package and manage dependencies in conjuction with Spring, then the application was Dockerized and pushed to Docker Hub for easier user consumption.",
        "JDBC App: This project uses JDBC to establish a connection between the java application and a Postgres database running on a docker container using postgres image to implement CRUD operations on sales order information using DAO patterns. The DAO connects to a local database and performs: creation, reading, updating and deleting through CRUD operations. This project uses Maven Standart Directory Layout. The application uses a psql instance to create, populate and query a database. Also, this project populates an ER diagram with DBeaver. JDBC is used to handle errors and act as connection driver to the psql database. The entirety of the application is allocated on a Docker image.",
        "Grep App: This application is a Java program to validate regex patterns. The application searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory and outputs matched lines to a file. This project uses the Maven Standard Directory Layout following the industry standard. Managed with IntelliJ IDE and utilizes Java Regex API, Lambda and Stream API's. Also, SL4J as a logging framework for debug and error information. The grep app is then Dockerized so it's easier for the user to consume."
